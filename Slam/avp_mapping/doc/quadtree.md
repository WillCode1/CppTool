# Quadtree 

## Introduction 

A quadtree is a **tree data structure** in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtree are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.

**Advantages ** :  versatility, good performance for insertion, removal and lookup. And it is easy to understand and implement.

**Why AVP need quadtree map ?**
